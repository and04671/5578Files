# GIS5578 Lab 4: Creating a Class


### Purpose
Object Orientated programming is a critical skill for writing code. After mastering functions, the next step is to develop and write your own class. 

The focus of this lab is to build on the knowledge you already have. Students use and refer to their previous assignments for guidance. Modify the code so that the class will be able to provide statistics for either a user-defined grid or a csv file. You may use the given script theGrid.py as a guide. Validate your code work, with an external script that initiates the class based on different input types. 

I believe I have provided you a useful guide, however, you can start with your own template. Start by making your code as verbose, clear, and simple as possible. 

# Homework

### Tip
When writing your code always consider is this necessary. Please use this base class I have provided you. Modify and edit as necessary to complete the assignment.


### Questions
1. In your own words define a class or object.

1. In your own words define an instance of an object.

1. What methods run after the mygrid class is initiated

1. Examine the method arrayStatistics(self,theArray) what is it returning?

1. Write the function columnStats.

1. Write the method gridStatistics, which provides the mean, min, max for the entire array. (Note: Think about reusing existing methods)

1. Modify the object's properties (self.shape) with two different properties height and width.

1. Update class with appropriate doc strings.
